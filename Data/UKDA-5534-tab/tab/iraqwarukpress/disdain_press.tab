21	Anton Antonowicz	If ever there was a performance created for a home audience, this is it" (Iraqis demonstrating in fromt of TV crews)
285	Richard Wallace	Paroting(sic) words stitched together by a raft of aides the cod-Shakespearean language did not hide the reality. He droned…
326	Rupert Cornwell	But he seemed more animated than at the parody of a press conference on 6 March, when he gave pre-cooked answers to pre-slected questioners who were allowed no follow-ups.
406	David Blair	Even in Saddam's hometown of Tikrit, marshals form the ruling Ba'ath Party drilled the demonstrators, telling them when to chant their leader's praises and when to wave their fists.
442	James Hardy	Mr Blair and advisers came up with the tactic of blaming France as attempts to win UN backing for a war resolution fell apart.
476	Ross Benson	At an emergency session of the National Assembly yesterday 250 delegates pledged their slavish devotion to the Glorious Leader. As soon as the meeting was over, however, they all made a mass rush to their cars to get out of the city as fast as they could.
674	Paul Vallely	"My fellow citizens," he began, wearing a lounge suit and tie the colour of dried blood..his brow was increasingly furrowed as if he were permanently perplexed.
686	David Usborne	(On CNN reporter given great access) Better than that, they arranged for the pilot of one bomber to flash a grinning thumbs up sign to the CNN camera while he revved his jets on deck. We at home were meant to feel fuzzy reassurance.
1219	Ross Benson	Saddam's ranting officials deceitfully continue to deny that so much as an inch of Iraqi soil has been lost to the Allies and the television continues the broadcast Saddam's speeches promising glorious success against the infidel invader.
2122	Bob Graham	"The [Information] minister's claims were not, however, suported by evidence produced yesterday by the Iraqis."

3100	Gethin Chamberlain	On the radio, the Americans are marching on Baghdad, their soldiers routing the divisions they said they had routed yesterday and the day before, the bridges they said were already taken, taken again. (Not sure about this as disdain?)
3373	Stephen Martin	"The Iraq nonsense machine was in full throttle too, promising to take us to the international airport they ludicrously claimed to have re-captured."
3528	Ross Benson	Al Sahaf "continues to churn out his daily falshoods and, to look at him, he is obviously relishing his own performance through the Looking Glass and beyond the boundaries of reality."
3543	Robert Fiske	"but the Iraqi army and the Pentagon did their best to cloak this little killing field with lies."
3567	Ian Black	Entire article devoted to mocking al-Sahaf's media strategies
3722	Paul Vallely	"Their [the Iraqis'] surreal Information Minister, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, continued his act of blustering buffoonery, telling reporters. . .At least when he ceases this charade we will know the game is up for his president."
4004	Kim Sengupta	Mocks US claims that rubbing the flag which flew at the Pentagon on 9-11 in the face of Saddam's statue before toppling it, was a coincidence.
4284	Donald MacIntyre	The cards gesture ran into trouble after US Cnetral Command refused to give the cards to reporters, or reveal the names of those featured. This prompted scepticism that the so-called 'investigative tools' were a public relations gimmick.
4316	David Charter	US Central Command refused last night to release details of the rest of the deck to the media, perhaps fearing a backlash for reducing the manhunt to a game of snap.
4375	Andrew Gilligan	"if there was any instance of that [selective coverage], I'm sorry to say that it was probably the pictures of jubilation on the first day." "The Downing Street briefers may live in a world where rhetoric is reality, where words are the same as deeds."
4739	Paul Valley	"'We're moving from killing to kissing', as another nauseous US Army soundbite put it."
