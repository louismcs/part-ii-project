124	62	Tank in the desert at sunset - a strangely cinematic photo to announce anti-war stance.
132	241	This is two-page spread including various maps and weapons. Coded as mixed for tone though this colourful montage is quite powerful.
137	142	As before, man holding baby at Halabja - should this be from 'historic' category rather than casulaties?

440	53	Harrier plane in green night vision light
452	200	Both photos not only show protestors, but also have police dragging people away - image of conflict rather than simply protest.
458	26	Shows soldier (Irish guard) on guard with union flag flying above him, sky is orange, headline down whole page on the left.
459	26	Same photo as the Mirror (in story not coded, by McNab). Also soldier in gas mask is the same.

605	111	Shows reporter in protective chemical suit following gas alert.
619	7	Picture shows Baghdad on fire - headline 'mass destruction' is play on coalition claims so coded as somewhat-anti. Picture goes onto back page as well.

656	200	Four photos here; one shows sit-in on road, one show policeman with bleeding head, two others show police either pinning someone to ground or leading them away - show aggressive side to protests.
670	232	Members of European Parliament display anti-war signs at meeting in Brussels, reading 'illegal war'. Could be coded as 'protest: other'.
710	203	Greek protester in close up with black tape over his mouth, outside US embassy in Athens

732	62	This small story celebrates the B2 bomber, photo has wing span across whole page. "Baghdad's time has run out."

907	39	US marines, one faces us, face covered by goggles and scarf, signalling hand gesture.
910	134	This is the same photo of the Iraqi PoW - the Guardian has chosen to blank out his face 'in accordance eith the Geneva Convention'
910	144	Also seen before, Iraqis signal for help for wounded
913	372	Small boy holds up a packet of cigarettes to pasing US soldiers (not in shot). He has classic desert urchin look but is not smiling, more uncomprehending look on his face. His suit-jacket reminiscent of 'Oliver' look.
917	202	A protester hurls himself at riot police at a Cairo mosque - similar to earlier photo but here we see more of the protesters.
919	200	Protesters with banner reading 'youth of today say no to war', girls at the front chanting.

933	39	us 'Sreaming Eagles' relax in their foxholes in Kuwaiti desert, surrounded by trucks.

1125	62	Small photo of a mobile missile launcher with a caption that notes that the Coalition is seeking to neutralise Scud batteries. Not explicitly labelled a Scud unit. Looks like file/library photo but not attributed as such.
1128	200	Close up of 3 teenage female protestors holding placards and blowing whistles. Just under it is another close-up photo, of a single teenage female protestor. This is the only pictorial representation of protestors for the story and the page.
1129	59	Photo of Turkish troops driving past a Kurdish boy is unremarkable, but the caption implies that one reason for US forces to "secure oilfields" is that this will prevent an ethnic bloodbath.
1132	241	Map of targets and progress is littered with sites assumed to hold chemical, biological and nuclear facilities. Their existence is not attributed to the Coalition but is assumed by the paper itself.

1145	39	Could be battle desert; US soldiers in foreground lean against each other or sit around, helicopter taking off in background.
1149	59	Kurdish women fighters in a Toyota truck, smiling and chatting. Caption says no Iraqis 'are ready to celebrate  while the threat of Sadam's power remains more real than the promise of liberation'.
1151	200	Attractive girl in anti-war protest. Caption says the Stop the War coalition said there were 400,000 protesters, yet the headline next to it says 100,000 - in the actualy story it states that the police estimate is 'almost certainly too low'.
1153	34	Soldiers ariving in the Al Faw peninsula, patrolling with helipcopter taking off in the background.
315	200	No War banner, with silhoutte of protester behind - 200 protesters barracked MPs outside the Commons after debate.

1168	33	Photo shows Royal Marines taking up position in a civil building in Al Faw, caption says under fire so used the 'mix of firing' code. Cinematic look to photo as one sodlier crouches to look around the pillar and second is on the floor aiming rifle.
1168	134	Four UK soldiers stand aorund an Iraqi who we see form behind with his hands on his head, kneeling on the floor. Accoridng to caption he is giving details of strongholds in Al Faw.
1178	145	Particularly upsetting photo of boy with 'horrific burns', his eyes and mouth open, which at first look make sit difficult to determine whether he is dead or alive.
1178	130	"Edgar from Texas" PoW shown on Iraqi TV, dried blood on his face, he is looking up and left to someone whose hand we can see on his shoulder.
1157	130	All photos are of US PoWs 'paraded' on Iraqi TV, stills from TV but would be interesting to see how similar the chosen still are in different newspapers. Emphasis here on their being 'terrified'.
1158	91	Two mug shots show the captured RAF pilots from the Gulf War. The memory of their image is used here perhaps to emphasise abuse of the PoWs.
1158	167	A medical orderly grins as he shows the bodies of US soldiers, the caption reads 'he even drags one into a better position for the TV cameras. The graininess of the images means that their faces cannot be seen.
1179	300	Small photo of Bush not particularly noticeable, but strange as the Mirror has the caption 'Wink: Mr Bush last night' in what seems like an attempt to criticise him, having him winking in a story about US PoWs and casualties.
1179	130	Five photos of the US pows being interviewed - the credit is to Al Jazeera though they are first broadcast on Iraqi TV.
1179	167	Final photo in group of six is of the 'gloating' Iraqi showing off the bodies of the US dead.

1192	145	Ths photo is the main focus of this story. An elderly man carries a badly wounded girl, her eyes closed and bloodied hand and face. The large caption (with headline 'in your name') is clearly anti-US.

1195	33	Marines take cover in building in Al Faw, also used in the Sun.
1196	341	Ten year old US boy holds photo pf his father, killed in the helicopter crash. He salutes and looks directly at the camera. (could be 175)
1201	200	Main pictures show a girl dressed up as the grim reaper and marching scene with many banners, mostly 'Stop the War'.
1202	145	The premise to this story is that it shows images to 'explode the myths of war' so all have emotive content. Here, an old man is covered inblood, his face looking down and hands together.
1207	167	Caption actually reads 'a smirking Iraqi surveys his captives' though these are the bodies of dead US soldiers.
1208	134	This is on opposite page to the Al Jazeera shot of an American injured PoW. Here the caption starts 'touch of compassion' as 'an allied soldier tends to a wounded Iraqi prisoner' - explicitly juxtaposed for effect.
1212	24	Photo also in Mirror and Sun, Royal Marine launches missile, blurred missile with lots of sparks and fire behind.
1212	33	Marines take cover in Al Faw, simialr to those used before but this one is not so striking.
1212	134	We only see the PoW form behind with his hands on his head with two marines - another caption said this was an Iraqi giving information.
1219	372	Close-up on Iraqi man weeping with a boy in his arms, after an air raid.
1219	145	Injured boy in hospital, his eyes closed - interestingly this story is not an attack on the coalition, but on Saddam.
1224	130	The Independent decides to conceal the face of the US pow in accordance with Geneva Convention. As the photo is large, the pixelated squares over the head of the soldier, with different shadings, gives the impression of phasing or rubbing out the face.
1225	135	Most of the PoWs have their backs to us, one who is lying on the floor 'exhausted' has his eyes blacked out to protect his identity
1226	145	Both of these images have been used beofre - one of old man looking down in bloodied dress, second of young girl carried by man - here the bottom of the shot is shown, revealing other casualties.
1227	24	Same shot of Javelin missile being launched - here it says by US marines.
1228	10	Seen before - Close up on bayonet held by Iraqi soldier's hip as they search the Tigris for a coalition pilot. We see more of the background here,people searching the reeds.
1206	10	Photos to accompany story on lynch mob looking for downed pilot in Tigris - codes not to helpful - unusual in that Iraqi soldiers though we don't really see their faces.

1256	24	UK marines launch 'Milan wire-guided missile' - in every paper so far, missile in blur with sparks behind.
1259	148	First casualty mug shot of an Iraqi - he is a peshmerga fighter so not strictly a civilian, either way we rarely see them posthumously pictured.
1263	54	Photo used on the front of 'Tell Me Lies' Miller book. Boys in rubble, they are looking just to left of shot, as if they are tryin to understand someone talking to them.
1265	10	In all the papers, bayonet held by the hip of an Iraqi soldier, in the hunt for the downed pilot in the Tigris, we do not see above chest level.
1267	200	Close-up of protester in mask with tears.
1271	130	US Pows on Iraqi TV, though the credit is Al Jazeera, the caption mentions Iraqi TV, wounded soldier is in the larger photo.
1273	91	Shows three captured US soldiers from Kosovo conflict, 'paraded' on Serbian tv.
1281	32	US marines launch a mortar, position of soldiers looks almost staged, reminisicent of famous flag erecting photo from WW2.

1281	32	Another action shot of a Javelin rocket being launched, not the same as in earlier papers.
1291	364	Iraqi Kurd family leave town, Kormal, after being attacked with US cruise missiles. No real link to story, other than they are Kurds.
1293	145	Re3peated image of small girl being handed to other helpers by an older man, she is distressed and bloody. Caption points to claims by US that Iraqis had given up denied by Al Jazeera.
1296	288	Vice President Ramadan, at a press conference, pictured from above - 'after US reports of his death'
1301	130	Familiar photos of US pows, Al Jazeera framing but caption says originally on Iraqi TV
1307	130	Middle picture is slightly more gruesome than the usual ones, I think it is a live pow, 'Edgar', though it is difficult to tell as he is lying down, caption mentions an Iraqi playing with a corpse but I don't think this is shown here.
1308	91	RAF pilots from 1991 Gulf War shown - short item on how to survive being captured.
1309	135	About a dozen Iraqi PoWs under escort of US marines. Caption says they took on 'powerful American tanks' 'armed only with machine guns'. Faces not obscured.
1312	62	Caption: 'British tanks near Basra, where groups of zealots seem determined to fight to the death'
1312	372	'Residents seeking safety are driven out of the city where diehards are hiding among civilians' - All the captions in this story frame the photos against the coalition's enemy.
1312	145	Picture of injured girl used in many papers, here she is just 'injured in the fighting' - no responsibility attributed to coalition.
1315	10	Photos of Iraqi troops firing into reeds and searching for downed coalition pilot - in most papers.
1316	59	Shot of marching Kurdish soldiers. Photo unremarkable but description noted because of unspecific code.

1341	38	UK marine in goggles and scarf, at position with huge machine gun on vehicle, caption reads 'prepared..commando yesterday'.
1344	26	Photo used to demonstrate land rover which two UK soldiers have disappeared from. Pretty sure this is an MoD photo used at the start of the war (repetition across time)
1346	371	Iraqi boys and men celebrate the downing of an Apache helicopter, mostly waving sticks, one noticable gun. Information ministers says peasants shot down the aircraft.

1572	56	Front page photo with 'Liberators' headline, a UK soldier hands out sweets to Iraqi children.
